## NMIS GitHub
Welcome to the [NMIS Data-Driven Manufacturing Colab](https://nmis-d3m-colab.github.io/colab/), a dynamic and innovative platform designed to foster collaboration and facilitate the fusion of data science with the manufacturing community. 

This GitHub repository is an exciting initiative by NMIS (National Manufacturing Institute Scotland) aimed at creating a vibrant ecosystem where manufacturers of all sizes, hailing from diverse sectors, can converge, cooperate, and co-create with research partners and the public sector.

At its core, the NMIS Data-Driven Manufacturing Colab is envisioned as a catalyst for accelerating innovation within the manufacturing realm. It serves as the proverbial bridge between the academic and industrial sectors, breaking down silos and encouraging cross-pollination of ideas. More than just a digital space, this platform is a nurturing ground where concepts and innovations can be transformed into tangible realities, ultimately propelling manufacturing businesses towards unprecedented growth and success.

This collaborative hub is being established in tandem with the new and pioneering National Manufacturing Institute Scotland facility, embodying a commitment to pioneering research and development in the manufacturing sector.

**NMIS Data-Driven Manufacturing Colab** is consisited of the following teams:
- [D3M colab administration team](https://github.com/orgs/NMIS-D3M-colab/teams/colab-admin)
- [DscM course participants](https://github.com/orgs/NMIS-D3M-colab/teams/data-science-for-manufacturing-course)

Before embarking on your journey within this collaborative space, we strongly recommend reading this guide attentively. It will provide you with essential insights on how to navigate the platform effectively and make the most out of your collaborative efforts.

### Code Repositories

Creation of Code Repositories is one of the fundamental aspects of this GitHub repository . These repositories are designed to serve multiple purposes, such as housing project-related code or facilitating continuous capability development.

These repos can have varying levels of access:
1. **Public Repositories**: These are accessible to the entire internet, fostering transparency and encouraging the sharing of knowledge and ideas with a global audience.
2. **Private Repositories**: In contrast, private repos are accessible only to designated groups or individuals, or external collaborators within the NMIS Group GitHub organization. This allows for a more controlled and secure environment, suitable for sensitive projects or collaborations.
   
However, it is important to note that any projects that are subject to export control regulations or involve intellectual property sensitivities, such as server tenancy, should refrain from using the NMIS GitHub organization. It is crucial to exercise discretion and adhere to relevant regulations to protect sensitive information.

### Naming Conventions 

While creating a repository, it is essential to adhere to specific naming conventions. This ensures clarity and organization within the collaborative space. 

Repositories should be named either:
1. **Internal NMIS Project Name**: This format is ideal for repositories associated with specific NMIS projects. 
   For instance, a repository linked to the project "Digital Fabrication CATP-01234" could be named as "digf-catp-01234-example-project-name."
2. **Ongoing Projects/Capability Development**: Repositories associated with ongoing projects or capability development should be named to reflect the team leading the 
   repository and the nature of the work. 
   For example, a repository focused on smart factory analytics under the "Data-Driven Manufacturing" team could be named "ddm-smart-factory-analytics."

To Conclude , the NMIS Data-Driven Manufacturing Colab GitHub page is a pioneering initiative that aims to revolutionize the manufacturing industry through the power of collaboration, data science, and innovation. It offers a unique space where manufacturers, researchers, and the public sector can unite, share ideas, and turn concepts into reality.

By following the guidelines provided, you can contribute to this thriving ecosystem and play a pivotal role in shaping the future of manufacturing.
