## NMIS GitHub
Welcome to the NMIS GitHub organisation!

Please read this guide before creating repositories, teams, projects or changing aspects of the site.
### Code Repositories
Code repositories (repos) may be created for projects or may be used for ongoing capability development. Repos may be public or private:

- **Public** - Accessible to the entire internet.
- **Private** - Accessible to designated groups/individuals or external collaborators within the NMIS Group GitHub organisation.

Please note, any projects subject to export control or have IP sensitivities (such as server tenancy) should not use the NMIS GitHub org.

### Repository Naming

The repository should be named as either:
- Internal NMIS project name - e.g `digf-catp-01234-example-project-name`
- Ongoing projects/capability development linked to team that leads the repo - e.g. `ddm-smart-factory-analytics`
